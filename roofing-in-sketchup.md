# Notes on SketchUp Roof Types

The easiest roof for a rectangular building is the simple pitched roof.

1. Use the pencil tool to draw a line along the long-centre of the rectangle's top.
2. Use the move tool to lift the new line up until the roof looks right. While moving, hold down the up-arrow to fix movement to the blue axis.
