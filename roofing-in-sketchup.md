# Roofing In SketchUp
## Simple Pitched
The easiest roof for a rectangular building is the simple pitched roof. Buildings with pitched roofs have *gable ends*, triangular shaped parts on the ends of the walls. 

1. Use the pencil tool to draw a line along the long-centre of the rectangle's top.
2. Use the move tool to lift the new line up until the roof looks right. While moving, hold down the up-arrow to fix movement to the blue axis. 

## Simple Hipped
A hipped roof has an sloped face rising from each edge of the base rectangle. There are no gable ends. The simples type to add to your building box in SketchUp is the pyramidal hipped roof.

1. Use the pencil tool to draw in the diagonals across the flat top of your building box.
2. Select the move tool and hover over the centre of the cross until a green inference point is shown. The hint will say 'Endpoint'.
3. Pull up to make the roof the right height. Lock to the blue axis by holding down the up-arrow key.

## Hipped with a Ridge
Hipped roofs that come to a point at the apex (or top) are not common. It is much more usual to see buildings with a horizontal ridge along the centreline of the roof. To make a hipped roof with a ridge, you need to make a >-< shape on top of the building box. There are quite a few ways to do this but here's one:

1. Use the pencil tool to draw lines from each vertex of the top rectangle to the centre-point of each long edge. This will make two intersecting triangles on the roof.
2. Use the eraser tool to erase the lines in the middle part of the roof, leaving just the smaller triangles at each short end.
3. Select the pencil tool again and draw a line to connect the middle vertices of each triangle. This will be the ridge.
4. Use the move tool to pull up the ridge, keeping motion to the blue axis with the up-arrow key.
